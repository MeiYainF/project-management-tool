      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        In a digitalization project there are two possible focus areas, digitalization and digital transformation.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Digitalization - The adoption or increase in use of digital or computer technology by an organization,
          industry, country, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Digital transformation - DT is defined as the changes digital technologies can bring about in a company‚Äôs
          business model, which result in changed products or organizational structures or in the automation of
          processes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are therefore two types of purposes of digitalization projects. If the project is focused on digital
        transformation, the purpose is to redesign the organization through the introduction of digital technologies,
        achieving benefits such as productivity improvements, cost reductions and innovation. These kinds of projects
        therefor share many characteristics with reorganization / restructuring projects. Digitalization projects are
        often related to a company's strategic perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the project is focused on digitalization alone, the purpose is to create value in the process by automating
        the process, improving the product/process or improving/simplifying communication. For the rest of this text,
        the focus will be on digital transformation as most digitalization projects also have effects on the business
        model to some degree.
      </p>

      <p>
        All projects have a set of common characteristics that separate them from the everyday work in organizations.
        For a digitalization project we could expect these characteristics to have the following degree of presence in
        the project.
      </p>

      <div class="characteristics-diagrams">
        <table id="digitalization-table" class="characteristics-table"></table>

        <img class="characteristics-image" src="images/characteristics/digitalization.png"
             alt="Digitalization Project Characteristics Image">
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Uncertainty is high in this type of project as many are affected by the transformation. There are also many
          possible solutions in digitalization projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change is a central characteristic of the project type, and this change is often the most important result
          (important impact).
        </li>
        <li>
          There are not so many limitations in this project type. There might be some time limitations and cost
          limitations, and limitations set by the end users/ those the project affect.
        </li>
        <li>
          As it often is important to involve all departments, and make the purpose and value of the digitalization clear
          to the entire organization, the organizational complexity is high. However, the digitalization projects are often
          internal and does not involve that many external parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Impact on business is seen as a success criterion, and is therefore highly present in these kinds of projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is a generic consideration of degree of presence in reorganization / restructuring projects, but it can be
        expected that individual projects will show individual differences.
      </p>

      <h3>Success criteria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create value in process</li>
        <li>Create positive impact on business</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Success factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clarity of goals
          <ul>
            <li>Make it clear to everyone in the organization what is being done, and why.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Participative project process
          <ul>
            <li>
              As the digitalization impacts the business, it impacts everyone within the company. It is important that
              everyone is involved to succeed with the changes, so that the impact has positive effects.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Good project manager (Knowledge and insight)</li>
        <li>Correct composition of project participants</li>
        <li>Motivated project participants</li>
        <li>Communication of project importance</li>
        <li>Involved and motivated management</li>
        <li>Clear project mandate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>(s.60 I boka: Suksessfaktorer tilknyttet karakteristikk)</p>

      <h3>Pitfalls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Not considering the changes the digitalization creates in the organization, and the people it affects. This
          can create resistance to the change.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not working toward the right goal. What transformation the company wants to achieve should be clearly defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Silo working (Not involving all departments). The digitalization should be understood as important by
          everyone. Silo work can create lack of motivation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Declaring success to early. Implementing the new tools does not indicate success by itself. The tools should
          successfully be used to create change and value to processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lack of faith in digitalization. Should be a belief that the digitalization can bring about positive change
          and value creation.
        </li>
      </ul>

            Very important stakeholder in digitalization projects. It is important to understand their needs, and to
            involve them in the project. This to ensure that the company does not encounter resistance to change, and
            that the change/impact will actually have positive effects.

            Involvement of the top management is important to generate motivation for the project, and to signal the

          <td>Project manager</td>
          <td>
            The project manager is important for the project success. A good project manager will identify how the
            project will affect people, systems, processes and surroundings. This is necessary to effectively manage the
            project.
          </td>

          <td>Project participants</td>
          <td>
            Digitalization projects should involve the organization as a whole, as the project impacts the business. All
            participants in the projects are therefore important stakeholders, as they are drivers for the project (and
            change).

            Resistance to change
            <ul>
              <li>
                A big risk for digitalization projects Is that the end users of the new solutions develop resistance to
                the change. This will affect the success of the project, as this resistance can affect how the new
                solutions impact the business.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td>
          <td>
            It is important with early involvement of those that are affected by the change. Stakeholder analysis is an
            important tool for the project.  Change management should be an active focus.

                Lack of motivation among the participants in the project will slow or hinder the desired changes and
                impacts. Lack of motivation can come from lack of faith in the solutions, or thinking the project is not
                very important.

                Lack of knowledge of the business and work processes, the digital solution, as well as methods for
                implementing change, can result in poor solutions that don‚Äôt have the desired effect.

          <td>
            A competent project manager, and a project team that is put together right is important. Where there is lack

      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        Information and communication technology (ICT) and software projects, can be seen as a subcategory of
        restructuring projects, were the overall goal is to achieve change in systems, processes, and peoples
        work methods. But, for this project type the main deliverance is more concrete than in restructuring
        projects. In information and communication technology (ICT) and software projects, there are two possible
        main deliverances;
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Procurement of IT-solutions and software project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Development of IT-solutions and software projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All projects have a set of common characteristics that separate them from the everyday work in organizations.
        Although there always be some degree of variance for projects, the degree of the following characteristics
        can be expected to be present for the project type:
      </p>

      <div class="characteristics-diagrams">
        <table id="ict-table" class="characteristics-table"></table>

        <img class="characteristics-image" src="images/characteristics/ICT-project.png"
             alt="ICT- og software Projects Characteristics Image">
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Uncertainty: The degree of knowledge towards the ICT-solution or software can affect the degree of uncertainty
          in the project, and especially the for solutions with a high degree of innovation it might be difficult to predict
          the possible events, factors and the development over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change: As a main outcome, change is a central characteristic of the project type, and organizational change is
          the result of the project if it is successful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limitations: There are not so many limitations in this project type. There might be some time limitations and
          cost limitations, and limitations set by the end users/ those the project affect. Restrictions, limitations or
          guidelines connected to the project and its outcome will vary by the different projects. In general, the solutions
          developed or procured will have some degree of limitations, but for the project type as general, this is not
          recognized as a key factor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Organizational complexity: The degree of complexity will vary by different factors. Examples can be the project size,
          how many people and processes that will be affected by the change, and the degree of change in the project's outcome.
          Number of departments and units involved, the need for internal and external competence and resources in need to
          achieve the set outcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Impact on business: In projects with a high degree of change as a outcome, the impact on the business is usually high.
          The amount of criticality of the project will also affect this factor. The degree of impact the change will have on the
          business or strategy will usually also affect the access to and priority off resources during the project.

      <h3>Risks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The main challenge is to develop a full understanding of the stakeholder‚Äôs expectations, and make sure
          the outcome of the project meets those expectations- communication and early involvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resistance to change- Change management should be in focus, this too create acceptance through

        </li>
        <li>
          Not considering the changes the digitalization creates in the organization, and the people it affects.
          This can create resistance to the change.
        </li>
        <li>
          Silo working (Not involving all departments). The digitalization should be understood as important by
          everyone. Silo work can create lack of motivation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Declaring success to early. Implementing the new tools does not indicate success by itself. The tools should
          successfully be used to create change and value to processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lack of faith in digitalization. Should be a belief that the digitalization can bring about positive change
          and value creation.

      <h3>Project organization</h3>
      <p>
        In project structures, both flexibility and resource control can be advantageous, however, the transfer of
        knowledgeand competence can occur, elements that are important for successful process optimization and work tasks.
        In functional structures, decisions may take a longer time and delays can therefore occur. In addition, silo thinking
        may occur, in the overall understanding of the project's importance to the business, or how the end users can be
        affected by the project result. Critical elements for this project type.
        <br> <br>
        For ICT and software projects, therefore, a project organization with matrix structure is recommended, ie a combination
        of the other two structures. The reason is the desire for efficient utilization of resources, exchange of experience and
        interdisciplinarity. In this way, the involvement of stakeholders of the project and the final product can be achieved,
        especially important in order to gain a good understanding of the processes and or tasks to be improved. A problem with
        this type of organization, on the other hand, is that conflicts between prioritizing other tasks and the project, and that
        a larger workload than normal can occur.
        <br> <br>
        A matrix structure can occur in a weak, strong and balanced degree. Where the weak is aimed at functional structure, and
        the strong against project structure. Since focus on the end users is central, a weak matrix structure should be avoided.
        To prevent the disadvantages of a project structure, a balanced matrix structure may be preferable.
      </p>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Understand the wanted outcome
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Early communication, focus and involment of stakeholders (especially the end-users) to make sure the project covers the
            end-users needs and is directed to the wanted change
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
          Resistance to change
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Change resistance is a important factor when dealing with this project type, and a focus on change management is a key
            factor for success. This can be done by making sure that the need for.

          Lack of competence
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure that the project team have the needed competence, that the expertise in need is involved. It is also important
            to make sure that the end-user and management have the needed competence to use the solutions.

      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        Reorganization / restructuring projects are projects that introduce new work processes, reorganizes the organization, training
        for use of new system, or shutdown of existing systems or processes.
        <br> <br>
        Reorganization / restructuring projects are soft projects. According to the framework for analysis developed by Crawford &
        Pollack (2004), softness and hardness of projects can be assessed in seven dimensions as shown by the figure below.
      </p>

      <img class="image-center" src="images/characteristics/reorganization-restruction-dimension.jpg"

           alt="Reorganization/Restructuring Projects Image">

      <p>
        Important characteristics in Reorganization / restructuring projects are that the projects don't have physical deliverables,
        but abstract. The projects also introduce change into the organization. <br> <br>
        All projects have a set of common characteristics that separate them from the everyday work in organizations. For a
        reorganization / restructuring project we could expect these characteristics to have the following degree of presence in
        the project.
      </p>

      <div class="characteristics-diagrams">
        <table id="reorganization-table" class="characteristics-table"></table>

        <img class="characteristics-image" src="images/characteristics/reorganization-project.png"
             alt="Reorganization/Restructuring Projects Characteristics Image">
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Uncertainty is high in this type of project due to goals being ambiguously defined, and many possible solutions existing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change is a central characteristic of the project type, and organizational change is the result of the project if it is
          successful.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are not so many limitations in this project type. There might be some time limitations and cost limitations, and
          limitations set by the end users/ those the project affect.
        </li>
        <li>
          The organizational complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          As change is central in the project, you would expect an impact on the business. In some projects this impact will be mostly
          internal, changing the way the organization works. This does not necessarily affect what the business delivers. In other
          projects it restructures the business to the degree, where it changes what they deliver.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is a generic consideration of degree of presence in reorganization / restructuring projects, but it can be expected that
        individual projects will show individual differences.

        New product development projects introduce new products to the marketplace. It typically involves all stages from idea, concept,
        research, prototyping, developing, testing, launch and market and sale.  New products can be:
       <ul>
         <li>
           Products that a business has not sold before or are familiar with but has been brought to the market by others.
         </li>
         <li>
           Products created by innovation and brought to the market for the first time. These products can be completely original products,
           or they can be products that has been modified and improved.
         </li>
       </ul>
       The objective of product development is often to increase competition and advances in technology, capitalise on a new opportunity
       and maintain and increase a company‚Äôs market share by satisfying a consumer of demand.

      <h3>Success factors</h3>
      <p>
        Robert G. Cooper has done several studies about new product development. From these studies it has been found
        that there are significant differences between the products that achieve success and those that do not succeed
        in the market. Cooper summarizes his finding to succeed in product development in 10 key points (ranked in
        order of priority):  <br> <br>
        1. A superior differentiated product that adds value to the customer. <br>
        2. A well-defined product before the development phase. <br>
        3. A product that reflects customers demand. <br>
        4. Clear and sharp product definition early in the project. <br>
        5. Resources for and a well-planned market launch. <br>
        6. Incorporate stop/run decision points as part of the product development process.  <br>
        7. Organize the product development around a cross-functional team.  <br>
        8. Base the project development on the company‚Äôs competence and resources.  <br>
        9. The world product ‚Äì a global orientation in product development. <br>
        10. Support from top management - follows up the process <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Pitfalls</h3>
      <p>
        The main challenges in product development projects is to create compliance between product complexity and degree
        of innovation, with good routines for scope control, follow-ups, procurement of skilled technical resources and
        close and good follow-up of top management.  <br> <br>

        According to the book ‚ÄúWinning at new products‚Äù by Robert G. Cooper, there are three main reason for failure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Poor or lack of market research <br>
          - Which leads to lack of understanding consumers demand and market situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technical problems <br>
          -  Related to design and production. This is often due to problems in the early stages of the product development
          process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bad timing <br>
          - The reason is often technical problems, poor planning and lack of control.  Missing the ‚Äúwindow of opportunity‚Äù
          (the time which is the most beneficial to launch the product) often leads to failure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Consumer
        </li>
        <li>
          Project team
        </li>
        <li>
          Product manager
        </li>
        <li>
          Top management
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Risks</h3>
      <p>
        Risk: <br>
        - Lack of interest for product / Change of demand, need and expectation of customers. <br>
        - New competitors and products in the target market. <br>
        - Lack of financial and human resources. <br> <br>

        Measure: <br>
        - Keep track on market situation and consumer demand through the whole project process. <br>
        - Thorough project planning to avoid going over budget.
      </p>

      <h3>Project organization</h3>
      <p>
        The project organisation consists of top management, project manager and project team:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Top management supports the project with resources and keeps track on the development.
        </li>
        <li>
          The project manager has the overall responsibility for the project and ensures that the
          project is on progress, are within scope, plan and process and takes actions if there
          are deviations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The project team does the planning, analysis and develops the product.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        Robert G. Cooper found through his studies thirteen key activities: <br><br>
        1. Initial engagement <br>
        - Invest in the project (human and financial resources). <br>
        2.Do early market research <br>
        - Initial market research; a quick and effective examination of market potential, needs and
        competitive situation. <br>
        3. Early technical examination <br>
        - Early technical research that addresses questions such as whether the product can be developed,
        how, opportunities for mass production and distribution. Investigation is often conducted as a
        discussion within the company.
        4. Do a detailed market research <br>
        - A thorough market analysis that addresses the user's wants and needs, concept studies, positioning
        opportunities and the competitive situation. Often goes as interviews and surveys with future customer
        groups. <br>
        5. Pre-development business and financial research <br>
        - The decision to enter a full development program. May include a financial analysis, risk assessments
        and a qualitative business assessment. <br>
        6. Product development <br>
        - The actual development of the physical product. <br>
        7. Internal product testing <br>
        - Testing the product internally under controlled forms. <br>
        8. External product testing <br>
        - Testing the product in collaboration with customers. Customers can try to use the product in their
        daily lives for a period. <br>
        9. Sample Sales <br>
        - The product can be offered in a test market. Try to sell the product to a limited number of customers or
        in a limited geographical area.  <br>
        10. Trial Production <br>
        A test production to see that the production equipment works properly. <br>
        11. Business analysis before final launch <br>
        - Here, the decision is made on final commercialization of the product. A final analysis before starting
        the sale. <br>
        12. Start of production <br>
        - Start-up of full-scale production <br>
        13. Market launch <br>
        Full market launch. Implementation of the marketing plan.

      <h3>Characteristics</h3>

      <div class="characteristics-diagrams">
        <p>
          Constructions projects can be associated with building, demolition etc. Important characteristics in‚ÄØbuilding
          projects are that the projects are affected by changing project specific environment and -limitations, and therefore
          has a high demand for/ is highly dependent of good project management and planning.  The product of a building project
          is usually tangible and measurable by physical means.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Uncertainty is medium high in this type of project due to a high amount of unknown information/details/values in
          the early stages. However, the uncertainty is excepted to decrease throughout the project life cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change are in most cases, not a focus area in building project. The building is usually not affecting e.g.
          how people live.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building project can at some degree be limited by project specific context, such as parallel building project at
          site, cost and time limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building projects are often associated with a high amount of involved contractors, parallel activities etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is in most cases a lot of money at stake in constructions projects. The outcome of the project can therefore
          be critical for involved organizations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is a generic consideration of degree of presence in‚ÄØbuilding projects, it can be‚ÄØexpected‚ÄØthat‚ÄØindividual‚ÄØprojects
        will‚ÄØshow individual differences.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ
      </p>

      <h3>Success criteria</h3>
      <p>
        Success criteria for building project is project specific. Some generic examples are:

    <p class="project-types-info">
      This section explains the terms used in project management litterature. Most of the information
      is taken from the book "The road to success" (2016) by Bassam Hussein. 
    </p>

    <h3>What is a project?</h3>
    <p>
       A project can be defined as: <br><br>
       <i>¬´... a piece of planned work or an activity that is finished over a period of time and intended
         to achieve a particular purpose ¬ª</i> <br>
        - Cambridge dictionary
    </p>

    <h3>Project organization</h3>
    <p>
      A project organization is a structure that facilitates the coordination and implementation of project
      activities. It is recommended to adjust the organization to each project's context. However, project
      organizations often have some similarities like a project manager, project participants, and in bigger
      projects, a project director.  <br><br>

      Hussein (2016) presents the following ways to organize projects:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Functional
        </li>
        <li>
          Project structure
         </li>
         <li>
           Matrix organization
         </li>
      </ul>

      Factors affecting the destination are typical:  <br>
      1) Pace of change in technology  <br>
      2) Resources available  <br>
      3) Business area  <br>
      4) Requirements for decision-making <br><br>

      <h5>Functional </h5>
      Functional organizing can loosely be described as Business as usual. In these projects coordination
      responsibility usually is located at top level.  <br><br>

      <h5>Project structure</h5>
      Project structure, also refers to as full authority projects are coordinated within the project.<br><br>

      <h5>Matrix organization</h5>
      Matrix organization is a structure for project whit shared authority. In these cases, authority and
      coordination of resources are shared between Project manager and department managers. Matrix organocations
      can further on be categorized as weak, strong or balanced based on allocation of authority.  <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Project phases</h3>
    <p>
      Projects are by project management literature recommended to be sectioned of in phases, with interrelated
      tasks and these are arranged along a timeline.  After each phase is allegedly finished, you find a decision
      gate, as can be seen in Figure 1.  These gates promote an opportunity to stop, assess and evaluate value
      creation and the process before further action are taken.

    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
      Hussein (2016) addresses 5 types of project characteristic. How a specific project relates to each of the
      characteristic indicates potential challenges that can occur in the project life cycle, and should therefore
      be addressed.  Hussein‚Äôs five characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Uncertainty
      </li>
      <li>
        Change
      </li>
      <li>
        Limitations
      </li>
      <li>
        Organizational complexity
      </li>
      <li>
        Impact on business
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Success</h3>
    <p>
      Success is a complex topic in project management field. A lot of factors effect the outcome of a project, and
      are to be addressed in the evaluation process. Following are some definitions presented to (hopefully in some
      extent) clarify one of the topic, in a short manner.
    </p>

    <h4>Success clusters</h4>
    <p>
      Husseins (2016) definitions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Project management success</i>: This measures the degree to which the project has managed to satisfy various
          project and contextual constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Process success</i>: This cluster is about how certain stakeholders, such as participants, line-mangers,
          end-users, and suppliers, perceive or experience project implementation phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Project sucess</i>: Measure project ability to achieve the intended transformation / ability to create an impact
          on business / strategy (value creation)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Success factors</h4>
    <p>
      Husseins (2016) definition: <br>
      <i>A ‚Äòsuccess factor‚Äô is a term used as a description of the ground rules that should be adhered to during project planning
        and execution.</i> <br>
    </p>

    <h4>Success criteria</h4>
    <p>
      Husseins (2016) definition:<br>
      <i>Criteria or indicators should be used to determine whether a project was a success or a failure?</i>
    </p>

    <h3>Pitfall</h3>
    <p>
      A pitfall can be defined as: <br><br>
      <i>‚Ä¶ a likely mistake or problem in a situation</i> <br>
      - Cambridge dictionary
    </p>

    <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
    <p>
      In the book <i>"A guide to the Project Management Body of Knowlage (PMBOK Guide)"</i> (2000), by the
      Project Management Institute, a stakeholder is defined as: <br>
      <i>"‚Ä¶ individuals and organizations who are actively involved in the project, or whose interests may be
        positively or negatively affected as a result of project execution or successful project completion"</i><br><br>

      According to Hussein (2016), which stakeholders who are actively involved in a project will depend on the
      specific project. It is therefore recommended that important stakeholders are identified whit regards to project
      specific context and environment. <br><br>

      A generic list presented in the book <i>"DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING YOUR STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
      SYSTEM"</i> (2001), by Andersen and Fagerhaug, can be useful to identify the project contexts:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Owners
        </li>
        <li>
          Management
        </li>
        <li>
          Customers
        </li>
        <li>
          Competitors
        </li>
        <li>
          Alliance partners
        </li>
        <li>
          Environment
        </li>
        <li>
          Employees
        </li>
        <li>
          Financial institutions
        </li>
        <li>
          Suppliers
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorities
        </li>
      </ul>
      It is noteworthy that, literature also do recommend stakeholder analysis, management and involvement in
      early stages in most types of projects.

    </p>

    <h3>Project risk management</h3>
    <p>
      The book <i>"A guide to the Project Management Body of Knowlage (PMBOK Guide)"</i> (2000), by the
      Project Management Institute, refers to risk in project management context as:  <br><br>

      <i>‚Äú‚Ä¶ an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one
        or more project objectives.‚Äù</i> <br><br>

      Project risk management (PRM) is therefore necessary to avoid negative outcomes. In the research paper
      <i>"Project Risk Management Methodology: A Case Study of an Electric Energy Organization"</i> (2016), by
      Peixoto, Tereso, Fernandes and Almeida, they explained that PRM: <br><br>

      <i>‚Äú‚Ä¶has the purpose to identify and prioritize risks that are likely to occur, providing guidance
        information for the risks response, and monitor and control the project risks, by increasing the
        probability and impact of occurrence of positive events (opportunities) and decreasing the probability
        and impact of occurrence of negative events (threats) of the project‚Äù</i>
    </p>

    <h3>Project planning</h3>
    <p>
      It is advantageous to be aware of some commonly used tools and methods for project planning before initiating
      a project. Project management literature (Hussein, 2016) mentions, the following list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Precedence Networks
      </li>
      <li>
        Resource chart
      </li>
      <li>
        Cost estimation
      </li>
      <li>
        S-Curve
      </li>
    </ul>
